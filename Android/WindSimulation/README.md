# WindSimulation
This is the Android version of my Wind Simulation project

Wind Simulation is a project to create a convincing wind effect in a field of grass, by using the simplest method available.

The project achieves this by using a particle effect, which creates a displacement map that can be sampled to affect each blade of grass in the scene.

Provided in this sample is an Activity, and the native code used to make it work.

The Activity has two versions; one written in Java (found in the java directory), the other written in kotlin (found in the kotlin directory).

The native code can be found in the main directory.

Wind Simulation is powered by Nova, my self-developed game engine.

For more information about this project, please read my blog post about the development of Wind Simulation (https://blackholeco.wixsite.com/portfolio/single-post/2018/01/16/Developer-Diary-Blowing-in-the-Wind-Version-10), or you can watch the demo video (https://youtu.be/HaqPLsO5yJ0)
